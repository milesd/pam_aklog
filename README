Purpose:

  When using AFS and Kerberos together, the login process is as follows:
    1. Run kinit to get a Kerberos TGT
    2. Run aklog to use your TGT to get an AFS token
    3. Now you can access the AFS file system

  Since the Kerberos PAM is available to do step #1 (obtain TGT) it sure
  would be nice if something automatically did step #2.  You can put aklog
  in your login script, but that doesn't work for services that don't run 
  a login script but still need to access AFS (such as FTP, or an IMAP 
  server that stores mailboxes in AFS space).  The goal of pam_aklog is to 
  provide that extra layer by having PAM grab the AFS token.  That way, 
  anyone currently using PAM to do the kinit can easily integrate the 
  aklog part of the process.


Installation:

  Very simple:

    tar xfvz pam-aklog-1.0.tar.gz
    cd pam-aklog-1.0
    make
    make install

  Updates to config files:

    1. For systems that use /etc/pam.conf (Solaris, et al)
       Add the following line to /etc/pam.conf:
       service session optional /lib/security/pam_aklog.so /path/to/aklog

    2. For systems that use /etc/pam.d (Redhat, et al)
       Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/service:
       session optional /lib/security/pam_aklog.so /path/to/aklog

    '/path/to/aklog' is the full path of the aklog binary.  If none is 
    specified, the module will assume /usr/afsws/bin/aklog.

    '/etc/pam.d/service' and 'service' are all the services you would like 
    to include aklog support for.

Usage Notes:

    This module can be used as either a session module or an authentication
    module, to accomidate application that do not allocate a tty and run
    session modules, such as SCP and Samba.

Tested Systems:

  I have tested the module on the following systems:
    Sparc Solaris 8 (gcc 2.95.3)

Technical Issues:

  Unlike pam-openafs-session, this module links in the AFS libraries and
  creates a new PAG for each login session.  As far as I can tell, this is
  the only way to make it work with Solaris.  If you are running Linux,
  I'm not sure how pam-aklog would work.  I'd recommend pam-openafs-session.
